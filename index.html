									<h3>About</h3>
									<p> Hi there! I am currently a senior (final year) undergraduate student majoring in data science at the University of Illinois Chicago. 
										I am passionate about addressing complexities and challenges in sustainability and conservation through developing machine learning applications.
										In my time as an undergraduate student, I have had the incredible opportunity of researching the viability of using social media image data for large-scale wildlife 
										population monitoring under the guidance of Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf. In doing so, I've been able to merge my passion for protecting our endangered species with my 
										fascination of unpacking and applying algorithms for data cleaning, feature extraction, data visualization, and machine learning.<br />
										<br>
										My research has been my primary focus during my undergrad years, and has ultimately culminated into a profound sense of responsibility 
										to take action by harnessing the power of data and using machine learning to surface patterns, ideas, and insights to protect our natural world. 
										As my undergraduate studies come to an end, I plan on pursuing a PhD in computer science that would ultimately grant me the opportunity for 
										not just lifelong learning, but further contribution to the research community with a special focus in sustainability and conservation applications - 
										domains that are only beginning to see some of the benefits from advances in high speed computing and machine learning methods.<br />
										<br>
										As the role of technology transforms and transcends its role in our society, I believe a baseline technical literacy should be provided to any person that is affected 
										by our ever present technologies. As a Latina woman in a field that suffers from underrepresentation, I dedicate time to contribute to my community and offer mentorship to students 
										entering the tech field. Participating in outreach and mentorship programs that work towards increasing equitability in the field of tech is something that 
										I hold with great importance as I continue to share my journey into the field of ML/AI.

										<h5>Ongoing: Fall 2021 -Spring 2022</h5>
										<p>As part of my Senior Capstone, I will be working under the guidance of my capstone supervisor to develop a video classification pipeline
										to detect humpback whales in videos. I am currently preprocessing video data to extract individual frames and test the performance of three different deep learning
										architectures for video classification.

										The anticipated end result of my capstone will be a deep learning model fine tuned for humpback whale detection in video classification.

										<h4>Machine Learning Pneumonia Classifier using Keras and VGG16</h4>
										<!-- <h5>Add link here</h5> -->
										<p> During the summer of 2021, I fine-tuned a convolutional neural network in Python using the pretrained Keras VGG16 architecture to
											predict whether chest X-rays are indicative of pneumonia. My dataset was sourced from a collection of chest xray images by the NIH. Throughout the process,
											I was able to learn about fundamental deep learning concepts such as the different types of layers in a deep learning model (convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers), 
											as well as dropout and how to choose an appropriate activation function. </p>

												<h4>We Can Code - Addison Public Library</h4>
												<h5> Instructor </h5>
												<p>With the help of the Addison Public Library, I coordinated and instructed a six-week workshop introducing 
												   students grades 3-6 with no previous coding experience to the fundamentals of Python. The workshop was centered around creating
												   custom pixel designs using the Imagilabs web app. 
												    
												   <br><br/>
												   In between coding exercises during the workshops, I would encourage students who finished early to experiment with the concepts and code to make the designs their own, which I think was a main driver in keeping the kids engaged and curious over what seemed to
												   work and what didn't. Allowing for this "experimenting time" enabled students to challenge their own preconceived notions as to how they thought the code worked, and come up with more questions along the way to cement their understanding. 
												
												   <br><br/>
												   
												   <!-- Part of the reason I wanted to start a workshop series at my library was to introduce students from diverse backgrounds to coding. I believe we should all be granted equal opportunities to
												   learn the fundamental concepts driving the technology we interface with on a daily basis. This was my first opportunity at being the only main instructor, and I was able to learn a lot on how to engage with younger students 
												   and work through their questions along the way. -->

												<h4>UIC & Noble High School Data Science: Summer of a Lifetime</h4>
												<h5>Teaching Assistant</h5>
												<p>During this one-week summer intensive program, I helped out with introducing high school students to the fundamentals of data science.
												   The workshop taught students how to code in Python, as well as how to download and clean datasets for data science applications. We also covered topics such as
												   single and multiple linear regression models, hypothesis testing, and decision trees for classification. At the end of the workshop, student groups presented projects 
												   on using decision trees for classification and what they took away from the workshop.
